# Z3-Java---Programming-Z3
 I am working through the Programming Z3 Tutorial with a Jupyter Notebook to try things out. Simultaneously, I'm working out the equivalent Java code in JUnit tests. Eventually, I will make a decision about whether to rewrite the KnowledgeBase class for the TrueJ language using the Z3 prover.
 
 Current Status: Slowly working through Chapter 2, dredging Python out of my memory, sussing out the way that Z3 is using Python, and tracking down equivalent methods in the com.microsoft.z3.Context class.
